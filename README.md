# 🌌 DSA Galaxy – AI Powered DSA Learning Platform

DSA Galaxy is a **full-stack web application** that helps users understand **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** through an interactive, AI-powered chat experience.

After signing up or logging in, users can ask questions related to DSA topics such as arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, and dynamic programming.  
The platform responds with **DSA-focused explanations**, emphasizing intuition, algorithm flow, and time & space complexity where applicable.

This project demonstrates my ability to **design, build, and deploy a modern full-stack application** with authentication, UI state management, and AI integration.
